title:  "5 Reasons to Apply to be a Presidential Innovation Fellow (Deadline is Today)!"

For the past 10 months, I've served as a [Presidential Innovation Fellow](http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows), working primarily on [open data initiatives](http://open.fda.gov) at the [Food and Drug Administration](http://www.fda.gov). Being a PIF has been both the most rewarding and most challenging thing I've done in my entire life. If you're unaware of the Presidential Innovation Fellows, we're a group of technologists, primarly from the private sector (though I came from [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov)), who are basically parachuted in to federal agencies for 6 to 12 months to solve some really crazy problems.

Round 3 of PIF is starting to ramp up (the Fellows start in June) and applications **close today**! The application is super easy (just go to [http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows](http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows) and click *Apply Now!*). If you need further convincing, here's 5 Reasons to Apply to be a Presidential Innovation Fellow:

### 1. Work on awesome things
As a PIF, I'm working to create [openFDA](http://open.fda.gov), a pilot project to provide several high-value FDA datasets (such as adverse events, product recalls, and product labels) as APIs and structured downloads. The possibilities of what can happen when developers have easy access to this data is insane - for the first time, people will be able to query and pull this data directly from FDA in a machine-readable and queryable format.

Other PIFs have done even cooler projects, like helping the Smithsonian [transcribe more than 3,000 records](https://transcription.si.edu/), crowdsourcing geo-tagged photos of diaster areas with FEMA, building [comparison tools](http://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/gi-bill-comparison-tool/) to make it easier for veterans to calculate their GI Bill benefits, and giving millions of Americans access to their [health](http://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/blue-button/about-blue-button) and [energy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/12/05/expanded-green-button-will-reach-federal-agencies-and-more-american-energy-consumers) records.

### 2. Work with awesome people
Every single person associated with the PIF program is absolutely fantastic. I've had the privilege of being able to work alongside some of the most brilliant minds in government, like:

- [Ryan Panchadsaram](https://twitter.com/rypan), a Round 1 Fellow who joined the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House after his fellowship before going to help lead the team that saved [healthcare.gov](http://www.healthcare.gov) (and getting on [the cover of TIME Magazine](https://twitter.com/TIME/status/439012651507539968).

- [Mollie Ruskin](https://twitter.com/mollieruskin), a Fellow currently at the VA who can take the most unimaginative person you can think of and have them posting up user needs in color-coded post-it notes within the hour.

- [James Sanders](https://twitter.com/jamestsanders), a Fellow who apparently didn't think building out how to get broadband to millions of students across the country at the Department of Education wasn't enough work and so decided to plan the first-ever [White House Film Festival](http://www.whitehouse.gov/FilmFestival).

### 3. Gain a new appreciation for government
It's really difficult to understand some of the major technology problems in government until you get here. The federal government is a massive machine, and while it could use some tuning up, every single person I've met here has been dedicated, passionate, and knowledgeable about their work. Being here has given me a whole new appreciation for the importance of our democracy, and contributing just a little bit back is incredibly rewarding.

### 4.  Start something new
It's really difficult to find yourself in a position where you have the ability to see a problem, think of a solution, and then actually have access to resources to fix it. Yet that's exactly what Fellows have done. Apart from our projects, Fellows have volunteered to work in a wide variety of projects across the government, from helping other agencies understand how to contribute to open source projects to launching [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov), a new digital service delivery team at the General Services Administration.

### 5. Give Back
Above all, PIF is an amazing opportunity for technologists to serve their country in an impactful, meaningful, and fun way. As I mentioned earlier, without being here, it's impossible to appreciate the enormity of challenges faced here every day. As a PIF, I'm working on a small, small fraction of these challenges, but I hope my contributions will help provide new ways for citizens to understand how their government works. Yours can too.
